so to summerize, first I activate a texture either 0/1 ... 16, then I look the the name of the uniform in the shader and put the number indexing the texture (0...16) to it, after that I assign the id of the image to the currently active texture, am I correct ?




Yes, you've got it right. Here's the process in a bit more detail:

1. Activate a texture unit using `glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + i)`. This sets the active texture unit to the one specified by the index `i`, which ranges from 0 to the maximum number of texture units (at least 16 guaranteed by OpenGL).

2. Determine the type of the texture (diffuse, specular, normal, height) and assign a unique number to it. This number is used to differentiate between multiple textures of the same type.

3. Get the location of the uniform sampler in the shader program using `glGetUniformLocation(shader.ID, (name + number).c_str())`. The uniform sampler is a variable in the shader that is used to sample the texture.

4. Set the value of the uniform sampler to the index of the texture unit using `glUniform1i`. This tells the shader which texture unit to sample from when it uses this uniform sampler.

5. Bind the texture to the currently active texture unit using `glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textures[i].id)`. This makes the texture available for the shader to sample from.

After these steps, when the shader samples from the uniform sampler, it will be sampling from the texture that you bound to the corresponding texture unit.
