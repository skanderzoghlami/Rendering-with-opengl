First we explain the framebuffers, instead of writing to the screen, we can write to a texture image that we can use later to post-process the scene_intersect
Shaders: screen fragment shader takes vertices data and tex coords and render the scene to an image
         Scene fragment shader takes same vertices and same tex coords but render the scene to the window, it uses the 2D texture of the scene to render stuff
Now we render the scene to the framebuffer, the output will be a 2D texture of the scene.
now we define a big cube that covers the scene, and we render this cube with textures from the created texture ! advantage here is the texture itself, we can 
do operations on it since its just an image and when we render we'll have the desired effect.
