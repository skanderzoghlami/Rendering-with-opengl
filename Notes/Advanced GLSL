- Vertex Shader Variables:
gl_position  => Must be defined if you want to render anything
gl_PointSize => Render points, and control the size of each point / gl_VertexID holds the id of the current vertex
gl_FragCoord => coordinate of the current fragment, x,y for the screen coordinates, z for the depth
gl_FrontFacing => True if the current fragment is part of a front facing face, False otherwise
gl_FragDepth => same as gl_FragCoord BUT, gl_FragCoord is read only, this allows us to modify the depth of the fragment, if we write this line, opengl disables early rendering ( this can be controlled by specific conditions to not always do it )
